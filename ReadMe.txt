/************* The Platypus Compiler *************/

This repo contains the work material for the course CST8152 - Compilers.

During the few months of the course, We gained an overview of how compilers translate predefined language into something understandable for itself.
The objective of the course was to build a Lexical Analyzer for the Platypus programming language. Originally created by Prof. Svillen Ranev, the documation for the platypus grammar can be found in the Documents/ folder.

The components of the Platypus compiler are the following:

- Buffer (to store the series of characters)
- Scanner (to read from the buffer)
-
